# static-web-demo

Demo app that demonstrates building static web sites using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

## 🛠 Add content

Make sure you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed.
* Run `hugo new posts/my-awesome-post.md`
* Edit your content using any of the supported [formats](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/), inspecting it as you go by running the live-reloading server `hugo server -D`. The `-D` parameter tells Hugo to also include drafts, all new content is marked as a draft by default.
* When finished editing, mark the content as ready by setting the `draft` parameter to false in the front matter (the comment-like metadata section at the top).
* Create a pull request in this repository. The content is automatically published to [the dev cluster](https://static-web-demo.dev.nav.no) (only available for NAV employees) when the pull request is merged.
